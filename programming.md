# Programming

## Language
Similar to a linguistic language (i.e. English, French, Spanish), a programming language is
a set of conventions on how a program is defined. It often involves more than semantic conventions.
Many programming languages are created with a specific programming philosophy in mind, which means
their syntax isn't the only feature worth considering when deciding which to use.

## Variable
Containers for information that is subject to modification during the lifetime of a program.

**Also known as:** a property, when declared inside of an Object, Function or Class.

## Constant
Containers for information that is **NOT** subject to modification during the lifetime of a program.

## Function
Piece of logic.

**Also known as:** a method, when declared inside of an Object or Class.

## Object
The most basic construct defined in programming, an object can be turned into anything.

## Class
A sort of recipe to organize portions of a program, it often contains the aforementioned items.

## Data Structures
Basic types of data permitted by a programming language.

Example: Arrays, Strings, Integers

## Array
A list of comma separated values, often contained within square brackets.

Example: `[1,2,3]`

## String
A string of alpha-numeric characters of any kind, contained within single or double quotes.

Example: `"you ain't gonna need it"`

## Integer
A non-decimal, positive number, just like in Mathematics.

Example: `42`

## Hash
A container for associated keys and values. Annoyingly also referred to as a `dictionary`, `hash table`, `hash map`, or `associative array` depending on the programming language and its community.

Example: `{ name: "Olivier", hometown: "Paris, France" }`

## Parlance

### Abstraction
Solving a problem by removing the need to look at the gritty details of the solution, and instead focusing on simpler and more essential components. 

### Leaky Abstraction
An abstraction that sometimes reveals the underlying complexity it attempted to hide, causing confusion.

### Smell (Code Smell)
An indication, sometimes indirect, that code may be brittle or dangerous.

### Anti-pattern
A technique that was proven to cause issues.

### Daemonize
Start something that will work in the background (as a [daemon][daemon])
